// ? Day 28 of My JavaScript Journey 🚀

// *🔹 Terminal & Its Types — Explored what a terminal really is — a command-line interface that lets us directly communicate with the operating system. Learned about different types like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Bash, and how they differ slightly in syntax and functionality but serve the same purpose: executing commands efficiently.

// * 🔹 Basic Commands — Practiced fundamental commands such as ls (list files and folders), pwd (print the current working directory), clear (clean the terminal screen), and navigation commands like cd, cd .., and cd ../... These helped me understand how to move across directories smoothly without relying on a graphical interface.

// * 🔹 Absolute vs Relative Paths — Understood the difference between absolute paths, which start from the root directory and show the full location of a file or folder, and relative paths, which are based on the current working directory. This concept is key to managing files and navigating large projects efficiently.

// * 🔹 mkdir & Folder Management — Learned to create new folders using the mkdir command — both with absolute and relative paths. Realized how easily one can build project structures directly from the terminal without ever opening a file explorer.

// * 🔹 Flags & Manual (man command) — Discovered the power of flags that modify command behavior, like ls -a (to show hidden files) and ls -l (for detailed file information). Also used the man command to read manuals and explore what each flag or command actually does — it’s like built-in documentation right inside the terminal.

// * 🔹 touch Command — Initially thought touch was only for creating files — but learned its primary purpose is actually to update a file’s modification and access timestamps. If the file doesn’t exist, that’s when it creates a new one — making file creation its secondary function.

// * 🔹 rm, rmdir, and rm -rf — Practiced file and directory deletion commands. Understood that rm removes files, rmdir removes empty folders, and rm -rf (recursive + force) deletes everything — even non-empty directories — without any confirmation. Learned to handle it carefully since deletions via terminal are permanent with no recovery.

// * 💡 Key Takeaway: The terminal gives you total control over your environment — it’s fast, powerful, and essential for developers. But with great control comes the need for caution — one wrong command, and your files might be gone for good ⚡
