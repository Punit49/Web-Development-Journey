Part 15 of My JavaScript Journey 🚀, What I learned in this part 👇

🔹What is an API — Understood that an API (Application Programming Interface) is a communication bridge that allows different software systems to talk to each other. it connect frontend with backend services or external data sources.

🔹Request–Response Cycle of an API — Learned how a client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with data or a status message. 

🔹JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) — Explored how JSON is the standard format for sending and receiving data in APIs. 

🔹Understood Difference Between JSON and JS Objects — Realized that JSON keys and string values must always be enclosed in double quotes, and it cannot contain functions or undefined values, unlike JavaScript objects.

🔹json.parse() & json.stringify() — Practiced converting between JSON and JS objects - JSON.parse() → turns JSON text into a JavaScript object, JSON.stringify() → converts a JS object into JSON text for sending to servers.

🔹AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) — Learned how AJAX enables web pages to fetch or send data in the background without reloading the entire page.

🔹HTTP Methods & Status Codes — Understood the main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and how status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.) tell us whether a request succeeded, failed, or faced an issue.

🔹Query Strings — Learned that query strings help pass extra data in URLs.

💡Overall Takeaway:
Understanding requests, responses, and how JSON fits into the process gave me a clear picture of how the web truly communicates.
